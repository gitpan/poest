=head1 NAME

POEST::Server::Events - Document all the standard events.

=head1 ABSTRACT

Comprehensive documentation on all the standard events.  These are the
basic events that a standard SMTP server should implement.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lots of events are created by the poest server.  We should probably
write them down for someone, perhaps even you!

=head2 SMTP Events

SMTP events are only self explainitory to people who understand SMTP
commands.  Of course, RFC 2821 can help with that, but there should
be a quick explination here.

=head3 HELO

ARG0 is the host passed by the client, if there is one.

=head3 QUIT

The client has decided to close the connection.  A handler for this
method should set C<$heap-&gt;{shutdown}> to a true value.  This will
tell the server to shutdown the connection.

=head2 Special SMTP Events

=head3 send_banner

This event is called as soon as a connection is established.  An SMTP
server sends a banner to tell the client who it is, that's what we
do here.
